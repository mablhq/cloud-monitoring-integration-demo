# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore
*.sh
*.md
*.ts
*.yml
*.yaml
*.crt
*.pem

node_modules

# NOTE: we are NOT including the .gitignore file! Otherwise, lib/ won't be included, and we'll have no code
